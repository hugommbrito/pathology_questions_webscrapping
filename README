ü©∫ Pathology Questions Scraper

This project is a Python web scraper designed to automatically collect answered questions from the Pathology Outlines website and save them into a CSV file. This file can be easily imported into tools like Notion, Excel, Google Sheets or other organization and data analysis software.

The code is heavlily commented to make it easy to understand and modify because it is intended to be interpreted by pathologists, not only developers. ü§ì
