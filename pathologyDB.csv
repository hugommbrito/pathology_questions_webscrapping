The patient exhibited signs of confusion and lethargy. The presence of nonpurulent serous drainage from the nose was concerning as it could indicate a cerebrospinal fluid leak from a suspected cranial trauma.

Î²2 transferrin Î² trace protein Glucose Radionuclide cisternography Ring sign",[],"['A) Î²2 transferrin', 'B) Î² trace protein', 'C) Glucose', 'D) Radionuclide cisternography', 'E) Ring sign']",A,"Î²2 transferrin. Î²2 transferrin is a transferrin variant found in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), perilymph of the ear and vitreous humor of the eye. It is a highly specific marker for CSF. Answer D is incorrect because radionucleotide cisternography is very specific for identifying a CSF leak; however, it cannot distinguish between a rhinologic versus an otologic source. Answer B is incorrect because Î² trace protein, although shown in some studies to rival Î²2 transferrin in specificity and sensitivity, is also present in blood. In certain patient groups, Î² trace protein is decreased and should not be used. Answer E is incorrect because ring sign is a visible halo sometimes found at the bedside of patients with bloodstains mixed with CSF. It has poor specificity for CSF detection. Answer C is incorrect because although the use of glucose testing strips on rhinorrhea specimens was once thought to be a positive indication of the presence of CSF, studies have shown that glucose can be detected in otherwise healthy patients. The detection of glucose in rhinorrhea is not considered sensitive or specific for CSF (<a href=""26370330"" class=""bl"">Int Forum Allergy Rhinol 2016;6:8</a>).",https://www.pathologyoutlines.com/topic/chemistrytransferrin.html,https://www.pathologyoutlines.com/review-questions?sid=3

Iron deficiency is the only option that is compatible with an elevated transferrin level. Answer C is incorrect because hypotransferrinemia usually accompanies hypoalbuminemia and is also an indication of protein malnutrition. Answer E is incorrect because nephrotic syndrome causes loss of proteins such as transferrin. Answer B is incorrect because cirrhosis results in decreased production of all proteins synthesized in the liver. Answer A is incorrect because hypotransferrinemia is associated with acute myocardial infarction rather than normal or excess transferrin.

35,Cytopathology,5,"A radiologist performs a CT guided needle core biopsy of a soft tissue mass present in the quadriceps muscle of a patient obtaining 3 passes. Each needle core is transferred to an attending pathologist during rapid on site evaluation (ROSE). The pathologist gently manipulates each needle core on a glass slide to produce touch preparations and then transfers them to a formalin container for posterior processing in the cytology laboratory. Following staining an examination of the touch preparation slides, a preliminary interpretation of ""scant spindle cells and blood"" is provided to the radiologist following each pass.

Aspergillus hyphae Goblet cells and alveolar macrophages Mucin Tufts of columnar epithelium with terminal bar and cilia Type 2 pneumocytes without atypia",[],"['A) Aspergillus hyphae', 'B) Goblet cells and alveolar macrophages', 'C) Mucin', 'D) Tufts of columnar epithelium with terminal bar and cilia', 'E) Type 2 pneumocytes without atypia']",A,"<i>Aspergillus</i> hyphae. Aspergilloma is one of the causes of cavitary mass-like lesion in the lung. The presence of <i>Aspergillus</i> organisms explains the mass in the lung and is considered adequate for evaluation.   Answer B is incorrect because goblet cells and alveolar macrophages are part of the normal respiratory epithelial lining of the airways. Finding these in an EBUS FNA sample would likely indicate contamination with normal respiratory tract cells. These cells are not indicative of the characteristics of a lung mass and their presence would not help in evaluating the mass itself.  Answer C is incorrect because the presence of mucin in an EBUS FNA sample is generally not sufficient for evaluating a lung mass. Mucin can be present in various lung conditions but its presence alone does not provide specific information about the nature of the mass, whether it's benign or malignant or what type of mass it is.  Answer D is incorrect because in an EBUS FNA procedure, the goal is to obtain a sample that can be used to evaluate the nature and characteristics of a lung mass. The presence of respiratory epithelium, such as tufts of columnar epithelium with a terminal bar and cilia, is valuable because it indicates that the sample is from the lining of the airways. However, it does not explain the presence of a mass-like lesion.  Answer E is incorrect because type 2 pneumocytes are a type of lung cell responsible for producing surfactant and are not typically associated with the evaluation of lung masses. Finding these cells without atypia would suggest the presence of normal lung tissue but it doesn't provide information about the characteristics or pathology of the mass itself.",https://www.pathologyoutlines.com/topic/cytopathologylungnondiagnostic.html,https://www.pathologyoutlines.com/review-questions?sid=4

Alveolar macrophages Degenerated epithelial cells Neutrophils Red blood cells Superficial squamous cells,[],"['A) Alveolar macrophages', 'B) Degenerated epithelial cells', 'C) Neutrophils', 'D) Red blood cells', 'E) Superficial squamous cells']",C,"Neutrophils. Presence of increased number of neutrophils in a mass lesion may indicate an abscess. Neutrophils can be present in various lung conditions, and more clinical information is essential to make a definitive diagnosis.  Answer A is incorrect because alveolar macrophages are normal components of lung tissue and are not indicative of the nature of the lung mass. Their presence doesn't provide specific information about the mass. Answer B is incorrect because in a percutaneous transthoracic FNA, the goal is to obtain a sample that can help diagnose and characterize the nature of a lung mass. While the presence of degenerated epithelial cells may indicate that the sample may be from a lung mass, a definitive diagnosis cannot be made just by the presence of degenerated epithelial cells. Answer D is incorrect because the presence of red blood cells may suggest bleeding within the mass but doesn't, on its own, provide adequate information for characterizing the nature of the lung mass. Answer E is incorrect because superficial squamous cells are typically part of the normal respiratory tract lining and may indicate contamination with normal cells rather than providing information about the nature of the mass.",https://www.pathologyoutlines.com/topic/cytopathologylungnondiagnostic.html,https://www.pathologyoutlines.com/review-questions?sid=4
39,Cytopathology,9, What is the most likely interpretation of this bronchioalveolar lavage (see image above) from a 51 year old HIV positive AIDS patient?

It is a nondiagnostic specimen due to the lack of alveolar macrophages. Other cells and material in this specimen, such as a few chronic inflammatory and mucin, may represent contamination.  Answer A is incorrect because this option is not likely as the specimen does not show the presence of atypical cells, which would typically be associated with malignancy. Answer B is incorrect because while the specimen may not contain clear evidence of malignancy, it cannot be confidently classified as negative for malignancy due to the lack of alveolar macrophages and the nondiagnostic nature of the sample. Answer D is incorrect because there is insufficient evidence in the specimen to conclude that it is positive for malignancy. The absence of alveolar macrophages and a clear lack of cancerous cells makes this an unlikely interpretation. Answer E is incorrect because similar to the other options, this interpretation is not supported due to the lack of alveolar macrophages and the nondiagnostic nature of the specimen. In summary, the provided picture of bronchioalveolar lavage (BAL) suggests that the sample is nondiagnostic due to the absence of alveolar macrophages and any atypical cell.
